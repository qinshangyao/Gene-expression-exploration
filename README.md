### Explore the expression of marker genes in Reactive astrocyte compared with Normal astrocyte using bioinformatics data


1. First download the microarry file from geo, then compare the expression of selected genes between the two group.
this project still goes on before I do the DEG analysis.(2020-04-8)
2. Push the tanzijian RNA-seq data into the project, owing to the outcome belongs to check a group of genes.(2020-04-8)
